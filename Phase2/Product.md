The goal of our product is for University students to be able to chat/meet with people who have similar interests or are enrolled in the same classes.

It is inspired by the app "Tinder" which is a match-making app (more focused towards relationships) that presents the user with a person (shows their face and their common interests), and if the user "likes" this person, and the other person happens to "like" them back, they are paired up and are able to chat with each other.

At the moment, the app supports user authentication, so the user can create an account and login. The user is then presented with another person who shares some number of interests, and the user can either "like" this person or skip to the next. Once matched, the user can view the profiles of people they have been matched with. The user can also edit their profile at any time, including their interests, and the matching algorithm will take these changes into account.
