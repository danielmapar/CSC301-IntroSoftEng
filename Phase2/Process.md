##MAJOR DECISIONS AND CONVENTIONS:

- We appointed Daniel as our scrum master, which was the right decision since he is taking care of our django framework backend, which essentially ties everything together.

- We chose Django since one of our team members, Daniel, is very familiar with it. Another benefit of using Django is that it uses Python, which everyone on the team has experience with from CSC108.

- We chose Twitter Bootstrap as our front-end framework due to its popularity and ease of use. As the name implies, Bootstrap is great for “bootstrapping” projects from scratch which is what we’re doing. This allows us to focus on functionality over precision in design.

- Our Github issue tracking process:  Create a branch and name it {issue number}-{issue name}, fix the issue in branch
