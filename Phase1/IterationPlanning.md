Release and Iteration Planning
==============================

See the User Stories section to see the corresponding user stories.

User stories for first release: 0,1,2,3,4

User stories to exclude from first release: 5,6,7

Reasoning for first release exclusions: Implementing these features would be time consuming and they are not required for the app to function reasonably well. Additionally, the "chat window" user story is too complex of a feature to group with the other first iteation user stories, and the "close/block conversations" story is the least important first iteration story.

User stories for the first iteration: 0,1,2
