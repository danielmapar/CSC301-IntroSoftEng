## Tony Cen

Tony is a computer science student at Uoft’s downtown campus. He is fairly tall, skinny, single and a soft-spoken person.  He lives fairly close to school and takes about twenty-five minutes to commute to school via streetcar. He doesn’t find school to be exciting. In fact he can’t wait for school to be over. However, he does enjoy taking a walk at campus from time to time for the scenery. He is an average student whose dream is to make good money and live in a nice house. Among many things he is a fan of baseball. He also likes to listen to house music and wants to learn to how dance (especially house dance). He likes to eat various kinds of food. His favorite dishes are fried tofu, shiitake mushrooms, seafood and many more. He also likes to take long naps and sleep in if possible.

## Chandeep Singh

Chandeep is a 4th year computer science student who switched into CS at UofT after a year of Computer Engineering at Ryerson because of how much he enjoyed software development. He's easy to talk to, and enjoys meeting new people. He enjoys school for the opportunity to learn many different subjects, but hates when all deadlines and midterms end up stacking up in the span of two weeks (I mean seriously, what's up with that?). Chandeep spent the last 16-months out of school for Professional Experience Year, a long-term co-op opportunity as an option for CS stuents. For the first and last 4 months, he worked at OANDA doing web-dev. And for the 8 months in-between, he worked at AMD on the Multimedia Drivers team. Chandeep is a serious technology enthusiast and loves keeping up to date with all the latest gadgets and consumer electronics. He's also a huge lover of Electronic music of all kinds, but is somewhat of a hipster and hates most the stuff on the radio.

## Nicholas Fisher

Nicholas is a Computer Science student at UofT's downtown campus. He is average height, and medium to loud spoken person depending on inebriation. He lives hella far from school and hopes that this 301 project takes off in a big way so he can make millions and drop out. Wait, no… a million isn’t cool… billions. Nicholas is a fan of almost everything. He is especially experienced at Web Development having had two jobs in the field. He enjoys Chinese food, Greek food, French food, Italian Food, Canadian Food, American Food, Spanish Food, Scottish Food, Mongolian BBQ, Korean BBQ, Sushi, Brazilian food, and on occasion, Lithuanian.

## Haris Shoaib

Hi, my name is Haris! I am a 3rd year Computer Science Specialist student. Currently, I am also a Jr. Web developer work-study student at OISE. I work about 5-7 hours a week, on a time that fits in my schedule. At work, I help my supervisor in completing small, independent tasks, which also helps me learn about the basics of front end and back end web development at a manageable pace. On my free time, which is rare during school, I like to play basketball, ping-pong, or go out for dinner with friends. I am taking this course because I am really interested in learning about popular software engineering methodologies and principles used today and later applying them in a team based project. So far, I have been really enjoying this course because I believe our team projects are giving me invaluable experience that is crucial for future workplaces. 

## Sandy Tran

I'm a 4th year student specializing in Computer Science. That might suggest to some people that I know a thing or two about computers but they would be wrong. Jk...(???). After UofT I hope to work in web development. Or, if this 301 project takes off =DD I'd spend my time discovering new types of music, board games, travelling, watching tons of movies and eating food. I enjoy Japanese food, Chinese food, Vietnamese food, American food, Canadian food, Italian food, McDonalds..etc. 

## Daniel Marchena Parreira
Daniel is a exchange computer science student from Brazil at Uoft’s downtown campus. He enjoys low level programming (C/C++ and Assembly MIPS), programming competitions such as SPOJ and UVA and he is always involved in a open source, or free software project. During he's days in Brazil, Daniel used to work as a software engineer (employee) in Brazil's main electrical energy company [CEMIG](http://www.cemig.com.br/en-us/Pages/homepage.aspx), he also worked in the same role in one of the biggest gas companies [GASMIG](http://www.gasmig.com.br/Home/Default.aspx) and two software consulting companies [INDRA](http://www.indracompany.com/en) and [AXXIOM](http://www.axxiom.com.br/pt-br/index.html). In all of those companies Daniel was used to work with SAP products and the JavaEE stack. During the night he would attend a computer science course at university [PUC-MG](http://www.pucminas.br/). Besides work in the industry, Daniel previously worked in a startup called [Fastdezine](http://www.fastdezine.com/beta/home) in his high-school years. In addition to that, he worked in a personal open source project called [UDoctor](https://github.com/danielmapar/UDoctor) that is basically a search engine focused in the medical niche. He is currently doing research with professor Andrew Petersen and Michelle Craig in the computer science department.
