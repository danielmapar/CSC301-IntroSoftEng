We decided to pursue our own project idea rather than either of the projects provided. Our project idea is a live messaging service for UofT students that matches users with other users based on their specific preferences. The purpose of this app will be to bring students together based on their interests to discuss things of common interest and perhaps develop meaningful friendships. We chose this project idea because we wanted to tackle an interesting challenge and make something that could actually be useful to the student body. We looked at recent phenomena in social media, and we were especially interested in how Tinder approached the dating problem. We thought the model that they had of matching people on chat simply based on their location could be applied to the student experience in some other fashion, for the purpose of friendly discussion.
