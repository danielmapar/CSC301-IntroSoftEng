MVP:
====

A chat app that pairs two University of Toronto community members based on profile information, in a way that they can talk on in a live chat platform. 

Features:
---------

* Allow the user to create and an account with the following attributes:
	* name, age, gender, interests (from the database), utorid, program of study and current year (public information)
	* email and password (private information)
* Allow the user to read, update and delete his account information;
* Allow the user to login using their email and password provided during the registration process; 
* After login:
	* The user will have permission to read, update and delete his account and also read others accounts
	* Filter potential contacts based on preferred profile attributes, such as name, email, age, gender, interests, program of study, and current year. 
	* The user can access an interface to select who he wants to send a chat request, this way he can start a brand new conversation;
		* After the conversation takes place, the user can send or accept a friend request 
	* Manage current friends (delete), and accept/refuse new friend requests

Technical Challenges:
---------------------

* Learning Curve:
	* not all members of the team have previous experience with web programming and technologies
specifically none of the members have worked with an online chatting API or developer a web chat application, which is the most difficult aspect of the platform 
* Work Methodology:	
	* Most of us donâ€™t have previous real world experience using an Agile methodology such as Scrum, XP, and test-driven development 

Unique user experience:
-----------------------

* Find people on the UofT campus based mainly on interests, program and year of study;
* Establish a one-on-one chat conversation that can leads to a new friendship
